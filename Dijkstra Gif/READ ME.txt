I have included this version which I call DijkstraGif.py

It creates a GIF of the path traveled. 

It uses moviepy which can be downloaded here:

I experimented with ways to use a try: except: with pip to ensure the import is downloaded.

That just seemed wrong.  If you want to play around with it, the list named piclist can be altered to make a gif of any path, of any length.
